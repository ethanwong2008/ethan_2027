### Markdown Notes


## HTML Fragments and Markdown Overview:

- HTML: Defines content for a web page.
- CSS: Adds styling to enhance appearance.
- JavaScript: Provides functionality and interactivity.
- Markdown: A simplified syntax that is converted into HTML by systems like GitHub Pages.
- GitHub Pages & Jekyll: Jekyll is used as the build framework for GitHub Pages, converting Markdown, HTML, and other files into a functional website.
- Themes: Pre-designed themes minimize the need for CSS customization, simplifying frontend development.


## Code Fragments:

- Markdown to HTML conversion: Jekyll automatically converts .md files into HTML using the Liquid programming language.
- Example Markdown: Simple content creation for GitHub Pages can be done with Markdown, which Jekyll converts into HTML.

  

## Images:

- Markdown image syntax: Use ![alt text](image_url) to add images.
- HTML image tag: Use <img> for more control over image embedding.

  
## Links:

- Markdown link syntax: [link text](URL).
- HTML link syntax: <a href="URL">link text</a>.


## Changing the Theme:

- _config.yml: File where themes are defined for GitHub Pages.
- Theme Selection: By commenting/uncommenting lines in _config.yml, you can switch themes. Jekyll supports remote themes and you can test various ones like "midnight" or "dracula".
- Theme Customization: Minimal CSS customization is encouraged to maintain a consistent look across the site. Custom themes should be tested across several pages.

  
## GitHub Pages Theme:

- Consistency: Themes ensure uniformity in layout, colors, and fonts across a web application.
- Customization: Avoid extensive CSS customization as it can be time-consuming. Instead, use the themeâ€™s predefined styles.
- Remote Themes: These can be added via the _config.yml file and modified with appropriate customizations.

  
## Minima Theme Customization:
- SASS Usage: Custom styles can be added to custom-styles.scss within the Minima theme.
- Popular Themes: Dracula for dark mode, Leaf, and Hacker are commonly used themes.
- Customization Tips: Custom styles using SASS can help fine-tune the look and feel of the website without extensive CSS knowledge.
