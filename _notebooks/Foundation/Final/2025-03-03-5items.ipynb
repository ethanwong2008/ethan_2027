    "- I had no idea how to use GitHub or VS Code.  \n",
    "- Now, I can navigate and use GitHub and VS Code easily.  \n",
    "- Over these 24 weeks, I have improved my coding skills and learned so much.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. GitHub Analytics  \n",
    "- The number of commits I have made shows all the hard work I put into this class.  \n",
    "- Looking back at my commits, I can see how much I have improved and how much effort I have put into coding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 8 Blogs  \n",
    "- I wrote a total of eight blogs about software engineering.  \n",
    "- These blogs helped me understand coding concepts better and allowed me to share what I learned.  \n",
    "- Writing them also improved my ability to explain technical topics in a simple way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Student Lessons  \n",
    "- In the first trimester, I taught my very first coding lesson.  \n",
    "- The lesson was about variables, including booleans, strings, and arrays.  \n",
    "- I was really proud of the presentation and the grade we received.  \n",
    "- Teaching the lesson helped me build confidence and understand the topic better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. RPG Game\n",
    "- This was my very first game project.\n",
    "- I put a ton of work into this to try and make it as good as possible, learning new skills along the way.\n",
    "- Focused on creating a detailed world, a solid quest system, and meaningful character progression.\n",
    "- I was happy with how it turned out, but there's always room for improvement, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot from the experience.\n",
    "- The project helped me refine my game design skills, and in the future if I have time I would like to make it better\n",
