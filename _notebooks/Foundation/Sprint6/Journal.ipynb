    "This week, I focused on enhancing the Quidditch-themed platformer level by working on the alternate ending logic and improving the overall visual appeal of the level. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worked on the alternate ending logic for the Quidditch level:**  \n",
    "    - Set up the base for the alternate ending logic, laying the groundwork for multiple outcomes depending on player actions.  \n",
    "    - Integrated the wand as a key progression item that influences the alternate ending. This involved adding the wand to the game world and ensuring it interacts seamlessly with other elements.  \n",
    "    - Completed the logic for when the Player collides with the wand. Upon collision, the game now triggers the alternate ending sequence, which adds a layer of depth and replayability to the level. I also made sure to handle edge cases to ensure a smooth player experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remodeled the level to enhance visual appeal:**  \n",
    "    - Made adjustments to the layout and design of platforms and obstacles to create a more immersive environment.  \n",
    "    - Improved the background and foreground elements, making the Quidditch setting more vivid and engaging.  \n",
    "    - Ensured that all changes maintained a cohesive style while also enhancing player navigation and experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan for next week:**  \n",
    "    - Continue working on the alternate ending logic, fine-tuning the sequence and ensuring all scenarios are accounted for. This includes testing different player choices and their consequences.  \n",
    "    - Assist any team members who need help with their levels. I aim to provide support in logic implementation, debugging, or design improvements, ensuring our overall project stays on track.  \n",
    "    - Begin initial playtesting for the Quidditch level to gather feedback on gameplay mechanics, visual elements, and the effectiveness of the alternate ending logic. This will help me identify areas that need further refinement.  \n",
